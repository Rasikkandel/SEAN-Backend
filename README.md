SEAN Backend  
A  Django-based backend system built for the SEAN Tech Club platform.
This project is designed to handle core backend responsibilities such as user management, content handling (blogs, projects, resources), and to serve as a foundation for a scalable REST API–driven application.

The goal of this project is to provide a clean, maintainable, and extensible backend that can power a tech community platform where users can publish blogs, showcase projects, and share resources.
