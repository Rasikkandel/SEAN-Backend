# Tech Club Backend

This project is the backend for our Tech Club platform, built using Django.
I am developing this project to learn backend development properly and to create a real system that can be used by our tech club in the future.

## What this project is about
The backend will handle:
- Users and authentication
- Blogs
- Projects
- Resources
- Admin management
The backend will provide APIs that can be connected to a frontend later.

## Tech used
- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework (will be added later)

## Current status
The project is under development.
Features are being added step by step.

## Future plans
- Create APIs for all modules
- Add authentication and permissions
- Improve database structure
- Connect with a frontend application
